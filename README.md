To use Diamond -Square algorithm to randomly generate all point for terrain, first in our script "DiamondSquareTerrain.cs", we create 128*128 point across the map and initialize point's location, then change the height of four conner point value to a random number in a range, then use the diamond Square algorithm with a random value plus on height in the setting range, to create a group of point with different height which will use to generate terrain.
